# Kubernetes Course

I am currently taking the Kubernetes course at [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/learn/learn-kubernetes). It consists of theoretical and practical content with verifications through the CLI API bootdev ([GitHub](https://github.com/bootdotdev/bootdev)). I will be posting progress screenshots of each module and its verifications. Later on, I will apply this knowledge to my finance webapp project to demonstrate my skills.
